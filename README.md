![Unity - Scripting](https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1691638_5a91_5.jpg)

This repository is used for a project at Holberton School to familiarise ourselves with Unity's scripts and how to interact with the GameObjects.

## Learning Objectives
- What are scripts in Unity and how are they created and used
- How to control GameObjects with scripts
- What is an event function and how are the most common ones used
- How to create and destroy GameObjects within scripts
- How to use namespaces to organize classes
- What are attributes and how to use them
- How to use `Debug.Log()`
- What is a vector

## Tasks
### 0. Ready player one
Clone this [repository](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x02-unity-scripting/tree/main) containing a `maze` Unity project. You will build on this project by adding new GameObjects and scripts to create a playable game. This project should be pushed to its own repo, **not** within a subdirectory.

Inside the `maze` scene, create a Sphere GameObject named `Player` with a Rigidbody component.
- Position: `(23, 1.2, 16)`
- Scale: `(2, 2, 2)`
- Material Name: `player`
- Material Color: `#0000FFFF`

![Maze](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-cs-unity/421/unity-scripting_0.png)

### 1. Bust a move
Create a directory `Scripts`. In this directory, create a new C# script called `PlayerController.cs`. Attach this script to the `Player` object. Within this script, update the `Start()` and `FixedUpdate()` functions to allow the `Player` to move when either the WASD or arrow keys are pressed
- Movement should only be on the `X` and `Z` axes – the `Player` should not be able to jump.
- There are many ways to create player movement depending on the way you want your player to behave. The way you implement player movement is up to you, as long as it is possible for `Player` to move through the maze.
- Create a `public float speed` variable that can be edited in the Inspector to easily modify the `Player`'s speed. The value of the `Player`'s speed is entirely up to you and how you implement player movement.

### 2. Camera ready
Move the `Main Camera` to position `(22, 26, 7)`. Create a new C# script in the Scripts directory called `CameraController.cs`.
- The script should have a `public GameObject player` variable that can be edited from the Inspector window.
- The camera should follow the `Player` as it moves. In other words, when the player moves, the camera’s Transform position should also change relative to the `Player`.
- The camera’s position should remain at a constant offset from the `Player`'s position.
- The camera does not need to rotate.

### 3. Insert coin
Create a new Cylinder GameObject named `Coin`.
- Position: `(27, 1.7, 24)`
- Rotation: `(0, 0, 90)`
- Scale: `(1, .05, .8)`
- Material Name: `coin`
- Material Color: `#FFFF00FF`
- Tag: `Pickup`
- The `Coin`'s Collider component should have `Is Trigger` checked ([Why?](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/3d-physics))
- Turn `Coin` into a prefab inside a directory called `Prefabs`

![Coin](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-cs-unity/421/unity-scripting_3.png)

### 4. Coin collecting
Create a new C# script called `Rotator.cs` and attach it to `Coin`.
- Within the `Update()` function, change the `x` value of the `Coin`'s rotation to `45` over time.
- Hint: [Time.deltaTime](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Time-deltaTime.html)

Add a new `private int score` variable to your `PlayerController` script. Set the initial value of `score` to `0`.

Add the following new function to the script:
- Prototype: `void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)`
- This function should increment the value of `score` when the `Player` touches an object tagged `Pickup`
- Write the new value of `score` to the console using `Debug.Log()` with the format `Score: <value>`
- The `Coin` object should be disabled or destroyed after the `Player` touches it

Place at least 20 total `Coin`s within the maze in any `X` / `Z` position you like, as long as they are visible to the player. Keep the `Y` position at `1.7` to ensure the player can reach them.

Create an empty GameObject named `Coins` to contain all the `Coin` objects in the Hierarchy window. Make sure the new empty GameObject’s `Scale` values are all set to `1` before dragging the `Coin` objects into the `Coins` object to avoid issues with the coins’ scaling and rotation.

### 5. Danger zone
Create a new Plane GameObject named `Trap`.
- Position: `(9.5, 0.26, 27)`
- Scale: `(0.5, 1, 0.5)`
- Material Name: `trap`
- Material Color: `#FF0000FF`
- Tag: `Trap`
- The `Trap`'s Collider component should have `Convex` and `Is Trigger` checked ([Why?](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshCollider.html))
- Turn `Trap` into a prefab inside the `Prefabs` directory

### 6. You've activated my trap card
Add a new `public int health` variable to your `PlayerController.cs` script. Set the initial value of `health` to `5`.

Add to the existing `void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)` function:
- This function should decrement the value of `health` when the `Player` touches an object tagged `Trap`
- Write the new value of `health` to the console using `Debug.Log()` with the format `Health: <value>`

Place at least 8 total `Trap`s within the maze in any `X` / `Z` position you like, as long as they are visible to the player. Keep the `Y` position at `0.26` to ensure the player can touch them.

Create an empty GameObject named `Traps` to contain all the `Trap` objects in the Hierarchy window.

### 7. The finish line
Create a new Plane GameObject named `Goal`.
- Position: `(-27, 0.26, 1.8)`
- Scale: `(0.5, 1, 0.5)`
- Material Name: `goal`
- Material Color: `#00FF00FF`
- Tag: `Goal`
- The `Goal`'s Collider component should have `Convex` and `Is Trigger` checked

![Finish line](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-cs-unity/421/unity-scripting_7.png)

### 8. Goaaaaaaaaaaal
In `PlayerController.cs`, add to the existing `void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)` function:
- When the `Player` touches an object tagged `Goal`, write `You win!` to the console using `Debug.Log()`

![Finish](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet.project.files/holbertonschool-cs-unity/421/unity-scripting_8.gif)

### 9. Game over
Create an `Update()` function within `PlayerController.cs`.
- This function should check if `health` equals `0`. If it does, write `Game Over!` to the console using `Debug.Log()`
- If `health` equals `0`, reload the scene so that the `Player` starts again from the beginning
- The `Player`'s `health` and `score` should reset to their original values
- You may have issues with the lighting preview in Unity when testing and reloading your scene. For more information, watch [Fix Lighting Going Dark in the Unity Editor When Resetting a Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-aUMLdIxRY)
